## Intro

Hermes is a PoC demonstrating how a UEFI module running in System Management Mode
(SMM) can be used by a user mode process to elevate its own privileges higher
than the kernel itself. This module is a continuation work on our previous
UEFI module, which was a simple [SMM rootkit](https://github.com/jussihi/SMM-Rootkit).

If you want to read about SMM (rootkits) in general, please read the old
[blog post](https://jussihi.kapsi.fi/2022-09-08-smmrootkit/)!

This version of the UEFI module contains the basic components to interact with the
Windows kernel (find processes, get all modules of a process, get information
about a process module and dump a memory range to file) or the basic memory
procedures (read/write virtual & physical memory and convert virtual to
physical memory). It can be expanded to include automatic forensic actions as
example. A drawback of Hermes is the current timer execution. The chipset timer allows a execution every 64 seconds, which is enough for demonstration purposes.
Finding another way to generate more frequent SMIs (System management interrupts) is left as an exercise to the reader.

**Supports (at least):**
- Windows 11 22H2
- Windows 10 1809

As the user mode application itself does not interact with any of the processes
or the memory itself as the SMM module is doing everything while the processor
is in the system management mode, antiviruses or even the kernel itself won't
notice the behavior but only the effects that were done (for example, through
DKOM).

## Example videos
The following examples show basic usage of Hermes suite.

### Dumping process memory
Hermes can be used to dump a memory range of a file, this is useful for reverse engineering of otherwise protected processes which can't be read normally or close automatically as soon as they detect a debugger or reverse engineering toolkit.

The following video shows Hermes in action dumping putty.exe:

### Reading Credential Guard protected memory
_LsaIso.exe_ is the credential guard protected version of _Lsass.exe_ which stores and protects credentials.
Normal toolkits (for example cheat engine) are unable to read the virtual memory of _LsaIso.exe_ as the windows hypervisor is blocking their access, Hermes fully bypasses this protection as it is not running under the hypervisor.

The following video shows Hermes reading LsaIso.exe memory:


https://github.com/pRain1337/Hermes/assets/26672236/f333d26c-bab3-4ffd-8b56-e47c612ac300



## Detection
The following examples show ideas and approaches to detect the activities of SMM,
but not in general malicious behavior.
Most of these could be evaded by utilizing additional components in the SMM module.

### MSR_SMI_COUNT
#### How it works
The MSR_SMI_COUNT increases every time there is a active System management interrupt.
For the best functionality, an SMM module (rootkit) would want to get regular
execution, which is not usual behavior.

By checking the counter, one can notice if an SMM module has enabled a timer
and hence SMM gets more executions than it would normally get.

For instructions on how to read the MSR_SMI_COUNT see
[chipsec](https://github.com/chipsec/chipsec/tree/main) which also provides
other useful information for analyzing UEFI/SMM.

#### How to prevent it
Spoofing an MSR is not easily done with SMM, the easiest approach would be to
utilize a hypervisor to spoof the results of the MSR.

Using a hypervisor will of course end in a lot of more flags.

### Side channel cache detection
#### How it works
Based on the idea of [Nick Peterson](https://twitter.com/nickeverdox/) which
he presented in a
[Tweet](https://web.archive.org/web/20211229210102/https://twitter.com/nickeverdox/status/1476295914423656456)
to use side channels to detect reads of a memory.

[H33p](https://github.com/h33p) has created a replication of this project in
rust, to test this claim. 

The initial tweet only claimed detection from os or hypervisor, but we've
tested it from SMM, and it was also able to detect it. It basically works by
checking the access time to a predefined memory location. As long as no other
application touches the memory, the cache duration should stay the same.

The test itself can introduce false positives if antivirus or similar
applications are running on the system.

Old video with the private version of hermes (named atlas):


https://github.com/pRain1337/Hermes/assets/26672236/882325d2-1416-4c17-a36b-e7e73a517f1d


- At 0:22 the virtual read function is used
- At 0:37 the physical read function is used

#### How to prevent it
This detection can be bypassed using the
[control register 0](https://wiki.osdev.org/CR0#CR0).

By setting the _Cache disable_ and _Not-write through_ bit before performing
a read and disabling these afterward.

This results in a big performance hit as no caching is used anymore but the
reads themselves won't be detected anymore.

### UEFI Image analysis
#### How it works
The SPI chip holds the image which contains the SMM rootkit module, the chip
itself can be read using manufacturer provided tools (for example afudos).

These images can then be analyzed using as example
[UEFITool](https://github.com/LongSoft/UEFITool).

#### How to prevent it
The easiest way is to simply just block the reading of the SPI chip utilizing the
protected range registers.

For more information about how to achieve this, check out the
[x86-64 Intel Firmware Attack & Defense course](https://p.ost2.fyi/courses/course-v1:OpenSecurityTraining2+Arch4001_x86-64_RVF+2021_v1/about)
by Xeno Kovah.

Blocking it of course leaves a red flag, as this is not expected behavior.

A better looking approach would be utilizing SMM as a Mitm to modify the read
SPI data before it's passed to the user mode application.

This was already done by
[TakahiroHaruyama](https://github.com/TakahiroHaruyama), for further
information see [SpiMitm](https://github.com/TakahiroHaruyama/SpiMitm/).

## Repository Contents

Hermes-SMM is the SMM-side "server" component which allows client applications
to elevate their rights.

### Hermes-Client
Hermes-Client is a interactive console application which can be used to
communicate with the Hermes SMM module.

## Building Hermes-SMM

Prerequisites: docker, git

### First time setup

**Please skip to "Building Hermes-SMM" if you've done the first time setup already.**

1. Inside this git repo, clone the EDK2 submodule, it will init the right tag
(vUDK2018) automatically:

```
git submodule update --init
```

2. Pull the official "edk-builder" docker image
```
sudo docker pull jussihi/edk-builder
```

**OR**

Inside the `Hermes-SMM` -directory, run

```
docker build --no-cache -t edk-builder/edk-builder .
```

to build the `edk-builder` image locally.

3. Inside the `Hermes-SMM` -directory, start the docker by running:

```
docker run -it --privileged -v .:/root/ -u root -w /root jussihi/edk-builder /bin/bash
```

or if you built the docker image locally:

```
docker run -it --privileged -v .:/root/ -u root -w /root edk-builder/edk-builder /bin/bash
```

Now inside the docker container, run

```
# cd edk2 
# make -C BaseTools
# . edksetup.sh
```

To set up the base tools. First time setup is done!

### Compiling Hermes-SMM

To build the Hermes SMM module, start the docker instance again in `Hermes-SMM`
directory with the following command:

```
docker run -it --privileged -v .:/root/ -u root -w /root jussihi/edk-builder /bin/bash
```

or if you built the docker image locally:

```
docker run -it --privileged -v .:/root/ -u root -w /root edk-builder/edk-builder /bin/bash
```

Inside docker container, copy Hermes source files to the edk2 folder:

```
# cp -r Hermes-src/* edk2/
```

Still inside the running docker instance, you can proceed to building the
edk2's OVMF with SMM modules enabled

```
# cd edk2
# . edksetup.sh
# build -DSMM_REQUIRE
```

The resulting OVMF firmware will be inside `edk2/Build/OvmfX64/RELEASE_GCC5/FV`.

For running it on real hardware, you'll have to patch _PiSmmCpuDxeSmm_. Modern
SMM protections setup by edk2 will produce a fault otherwise when accessing
normal OS memory. Check out
[How to patch PiSmmCpuDxeSmm](#how-to-patch-pismmcpudxesmm)

## Building Hermes-Client

To build the Hermes-Client you need to use visual studio instead of docker.

Simply open the Solution file and compile, you might need platform/sdk/toolset
on the project file first.

The default settings compile a x64-86 application for windows.

## Troubleshooting
This version was developed for and tested on the Intel z690 chipset, it should
still work on older/newer chipsets as very few offsets are changed.

The SMM module itself also works in a virtualized environment, although some of
the native chipset feature it uses (SMI timer) are not available there.

If the SMM module is not working as expected, you can use the inbuilt serial
functions to send text/numbers out. This even works, if the SMM module produces
a General Exception which halts the system.

## FAQ

### How to patch PiSmmCpuDxeSmm

If you are trying to run this SMM module on real hardware, you need to patch
your motherboard's `PiSmmCpuDxeSmm` module from the UEFI firmware. You can mimick
[our patch](https://github.com/jussihi/SMM-Rootkit/tree/master/SMM%20Rootkit/UefiCpuPkg)
by Patching this variable initialization out and hard code the variable itself to
0 with your favorite disassembler (IDA or similar):

https://github.com/tianocore/edk2/blob/master/UefiCpuPkg/PiSmmCpuDxeSmm/X64/PageTbl.c#L352

Easiest way to find that function (SmmInitPageTable) is to search for the
strings of the error messages:

https://github.com/tianocore/edk2/blob/master/UefiCpuPkg/Library/CpuExceptionHandlerLib/X64/ArchExceptionHandler.c#L265

Which is referenced multiple times in the SMI Page fault handler:

https://github.com/tianocore/edk2/blob/master/UefiCpuPkg/PiSmmCpuDxeSmm/X64/PageTbl.c#L1003

And the page fault handler is initialized in the same function as the variable
initialization (SmmInitPageTable):

https://github.com/tianocore/edk2/blob/master/UefiCpuPkg/PiSmmCpuDxeSmm/X64/PageTbl.c#L442

### No serial output after boot

Sometimes the serial traffic is blocked because of the operating system's own serial
driver. This is at least the case in Windows systems when not booting inside
a (QEMU/KVM) virtual machine.

#### There are two ways to get serial working on this sort of situation:

- Block the Operating System from loading the driver.

On GNU+Linux, you can disable the driver completely if one is loaded. On
Windows systems, you might need to rename/delete the system's serial driver.
The default path to the driver executable is
`C:\Windows\System32\drivers\serial.sys`.

- Open an SSH client locally

You can also open the connection to the local serial port using your favorite
serial client. At least on Windows this will prevent Windows own driver from
suppressing the serial output.
